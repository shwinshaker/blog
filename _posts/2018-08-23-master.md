# My master thesis
* Supervised by [Prof. Liyong Zhou](https://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/11403/)

# A brief summary
* Performed a large number of simulations on the close encounters between Plutinos and Neptune Trojans under complex orbital and physical conditions
* Analyzed the statistical results in detail and proposed a statistical model based on markov process to well explain some notable behaviours
* Combined the geometrical relationship and the statistical model to be a semi-analytical approach to reproduce the physical pattern

# Some fruits
