    <h4>- Curiosity and Enthusiasm -</h4>

<p class="about">
My name is Chengyu Dong. Currently I am a master student in Computer Science at UC San Diego. Before my transition to computer science, I studied Astronomy in Nanjing University and obtained a master degree in Celestial Mechanics and a bachelor degree in Astronomy. In one of the best schools of Astronomy in the world, I was immersed in academic research and had some publications and talks.
</p>
<p class="about">
That being said, my original focus during undergraduate days was not Astronomy. By means of a prize in Chemistry competition back in high school, I was admitted to Kuang Yaming Honors School in Nanjing University, which conducts an intensive program in basic science. We had to take courses in various topics including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Programming. In junior year we were offered choices of further study and research in these fields and I chose Astronomy merely due to curiosity. Therefore, I identify myself as a guy with interdisciplinary background.<br\>

<p class="about">
I am curious about almost everything on the earth (or beyond Earth perhaps). The world is just so fascinating that I can't stop thinking about why. I could spend hours exploring answers online to convince myself that something is reasonable. Some weird questions that cost me quite some efforts include why the image in a mirror is flipped horizontally but not vertically. I always believe that curiosity is the first step lead to success, especially in research. I enjoy solving problems piece by piece while being motivated by a big "why". I can't imagine a life composed of problem solving without the need to think about the reasons. So probably that's why I prefer academic research as a career choice.
</p>
<p class="about">
Though the whole world is full of mysteries, it is obvious that I cannot focus on all these things. Through my academic years in Astronomy, I gradually found that it's not the moons and stars that attract me the most, but the data, and all the mathematic tools and physical theories to exploit and explain them. I would just spend days on visualizing a statistical result, before the graph clearly made my point. That's probably the main reason that I switched to Computer Science. Further, I would like to indulge this passion and devote to data science and related fields. So right at this moment I am eagerly seeking a research direction that I can dedicate all my interests and energy to, and hopefully I will make some achievements.
