My name is Chengyu Dong. Currently I am a master student in Computer Science at UC San Diego. Before my transition to computer science, I studied Astronomy in Nanjing University and obtained a master degree in Celestial Mechanics and a bachelor degree in Astronomy. In one of the best schools of Astronomy in the world, I was immersed in academic research and had some publications and talks. That being said, my original focus during undergraduate days was not Astronomy. Because of a prize in Chemistry competition back in high school, I was admitted to Kuang Yaming Honors School in Nanjing University, which conducts an intensive program in Science. We had to take courses in various topics including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Programming. In junior year we were offered choices of further study in these fields and I chose Astronomy merely due to curiosity. Therefore, I identify myself as a guy with interdisciplinary background. I am curious about almost everything on the earth (or beyond the earth perhaps), but sadly, it is obvious that I cannot focus on all these things. So right at this moment i am eagerly seeking a research field that i can dedicate all my interests and energy to, and hopefully i will enjoy some achievements.
